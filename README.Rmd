The goal of `wodds` is to make the calculations of whisker odds (wodds) easy.
Wodds follow the same rules as letter-values, but with a different naming 
system.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `wodds` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexhallam/wodds")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example 1}
options(digits=1)
library(wodds)
library(knitr)
set.seed(42)
a <- rnorm(n = 1e4, 0, 1)
df_wodds <- wodds::wodds(a)
df_wodds
```

Outliers beyond the last `wodd` are marked with `O<value>` in ascending order. There should 
rarely be more than 7 outliers when using `wodds`.

```{r example 1.1}
df_wodds_and_outs <- wodds::wodds(a, include_outliers = TRUE)
df_wodds_and_outs
```

Though not necessary it is possible to include tail area if additional communication or
teaching is needed. It is assumed that the `wodd` should be explanatory enough
to not need to rely on `tail_area`.

```{r example 1.2}
df_wodds_and_outs <- wodds::wodds(a, include_tail_area  = TRUE)
df_wodds_and_outs
```

An example with all options set to `TRUE`.

```{r example 1.3}
df_wodds_and_outs <- wodds::wodds(a, include_depth = TRUE, include_tail_area = TRUE, include_outliers = TRUE)
df_wodds_and_outs
```

A `knitr::kable` example for publication.

```{r example 2}
knitr::kable(df_wodds_and_outs, align = 'c',digits = 3)
```

### Getting the depth

```{r example 3}
wodds::get_depth_from_n(n=15734L, alpha = 0.05)
```


### Getting the sample size

```{r example 4}
wodds::get_n_from_depth(d = 11L)
```

## Whisker Odds and Letter-Values

Letter-Values are a fantastic tool! I think the naming could be improved. 
For this reason I introduce whisker odds (wodds) as an alternative naming system.
My hypothesis is that with an alternative naming system the use of these 
descriptive statistics will be see more use. This is a rebranding of a what I
think is a powerful modern statistical tool.
